 * Marks a class to be initialized with the RPC methods.

 * All {@code public static} fields are constructed and the {@code static} constructor block is called.
 * This needs to be done to ensure the methods are registered at the correct time, which is usually before {@code ModInitializer$initialize()} is called.
 * Accessing the class before this time will likely result in failure to register correctly or exceptions being thrown.
 * <p>
 * The {@code priority} property can be used if dependencies exist. Higher priorities are registered first.
